// The real `Measure` the app hands to `planExport`, as opposed to the stubs
// tests inject (see `export-plan.ts`'s `unmeasured` and the hand-built
// `Measure`s in `export-plan.test.ts`). Both halves work the same way: ask the
// browser what the real thing comes out as, off-screen, and hand back a number.
//
// `itemHeight` (#7) needs layout, not text metrics: a page item's height is the
// height of its rich text, its images and its choice grid once they are laid out
// at the page's content width. So it renders the item — through
// `PageItemMeasureView`, the very components `exam-page.tsx` draws on screen —
// into one reused off-screen host sized to `PAGE_CONTENT_WIDTH`, and measures
// the host.
//
// Two things about that host matter and are easy to undo by accident:
//
//   - It is `display: flow-root` (see `.measure-host` in styles.css), so a top
//     item margin is contained rather than collapsing out of the host and going
//     unmeasured.
//   - Page items must keep a zero top margin, since each one is measured alone
//     and the heights are then summed. Bottom margins are what separates them.
//
// This is the one place in the app that reads a layout property, and it is why
// `planExport` never has to: everything downstream of `Measure` is arithmetic.
